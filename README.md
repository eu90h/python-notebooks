# python-notebooks
This repository contains short expository notes on machine learning and statistics. The content here was written primarily to strengthen my own understanding of the material and to gain practice using JAX. Many of the notebooks here also appear on my [personal site](https://eu90h.github.io/). Hopefully you find these notebooks useful :blush:.
